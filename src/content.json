While many existing tools focus on tracking rides or displaying trail data, MTB Group Ride centers on community — helping riders actually meet and ride together in real life.",

This makes it difficult for riders — especially those new to an area — to discover rides or participate consistently. At the same time, popular MTB apps focus heavily on ride tracking and trail information, but not on connecting the people riding those trails.",
